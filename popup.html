Hi, I'm looking to start building a chrome extension. I've never built one before. My idea is something called the "Make Everything Better Button" 

I have a bunch of ideas on what to do, but would like your help. I think I'd like to start small and easy and have the button show you a picture of a puppy when you click it. I'm going to upload a PRD-esque document on my thoughts for what the future of this tool could look like.

12:21 PM
What a fun project! A puppy button is the perfect place to start — simple, testable, and immediately rewarding.

Here's everything you need to build your first Chrome extension that shows a puppy picture when clicked.

The 4 files you need:

A Chrome extension is really just a folder with a few files. Here's what we'll create:

manifest.json — the config file that tells Chrome what your extension is
popup.html — the little window that appears when you click the extension icon
popup.js — the logic that fetches a puppy photo
An icon image (we'll use a placeholder for now)
Let me generate those files for you.


Created 3 files, ran 2 commands, read a file
Created 3 files, ran 2 commands, read a file
Download the zip and follow these steps to install it:

How to load it in Chrome:

Unzip the folder somewhere permanent (like your Desktop)
Go to chrome://extensions in your browser
Toggle on Developer mode (top right corner)
Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder
The extension will appear in your toolbar — click it!
What it does:

Automatically loads a random dog photo the moment you open it (using the free dog.ceo API — no key needed)
Shows a random cheeky caption each time
"Another One" button to keep fetching more dogs
A few things to know as you grow this:

The manifest.json is the heart of any Chrome extension — that's where you declare permissions, pages, background scripts, etc.
When you're ready to add the Mood Boost / Anxiety / Productivity modes from your doc, the natural next step is adding a settings page and some tab-based navigation in the popup
The dog.ceo API is solid for now, but you could swap in The Dog API or Cat API later for more control
Want to tackle any of the other modes next?

Make everything better
ZIP 
I'd like to be able to make updates and refresh the extension so it catches those updates. Will it automatically do that if I update and save one of the files? Or should I store it somewhere like github?

12:33 PM
Great questions — here's how both things work:

Auto-refresh: No, but it's one click. When you edit a file directly in the unzipped folder, Chrome doesn't pick up the changes automatically. You just need to go back to chrome://extensions and click the refresh icon (circular arrow) on your extension's card. Then re-open the popup and your changes are live. That's it — no rezipping, no reinstalling.

GitHub: Yes, do this. Not because it helps with the refresh flow, but because it's just good practice and will save you pain later. The setup would be:

Create a repo on GitHub and push your unzipped folder to it
When you want to make a change — edit the file in your local folder (cloned from GitHub), save it, push to GitHub, then hit refresh on chrome://extensions
That way you have version history, can roll back if you break something, and have a backup that isn't just sitting on your Desktop. For a solo project like this it's pretty lightweight to set up.

The simple mental model for your workflow:

Edit file → Save → chrome://extensions refresh button → Test

GitHub just lives between "Save" and the refresh step when you want to commit. You don't have to push every single save — you can batch changes and push when something feels "done."

Want help setting up the GitHub repo or a .gitignore file for it?

I've created the github repo, but yes can you help me set up a .gitignore file

12:35 PM
Simple one for a Chrome extension:


Created a file, read a file
Created a file, read a file
Drop this in the root of your project folder (same level as manifest.json). A few notes on what's in there:

.DS_Store — Mac system files that Git would otherwise track and clutter your repo with. Always ignore these.

**.zip / .crx — You don't need to commit build artifacts since the source files are the extension. Anyone can just load unpacked from the source.

node_modules — You don't have any Node dependencies right now, but the day you add a build tool (like if you ever want to use TypeScript or bundle things), you'll already be covered.

Once it's in your folder, just run git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Add gitignore" and you're good.

.gitignore
GITIGNORE 
Sorry, what should this file be called? just ".gitignore"

12:38 PM
Yes, exactly — just .gitignore with nothing before the dot. It's one of those files where the name is the extension.

If you're on a Mac, be aware that files starting with a dot are hidden by default in Finder. You won't see it there, but Git and your terminal will find it just fine. If you ever need to confirm it's there you can run ls -a in your project folder in the terminal and it'll show up.

In terminal how do I set it up so I can run git commands directly from my repo

12:38 PM
You just need to navigate to your repo folder in the terminal. Run:

cd path/to/your/folder
For example if your repo is on your Desktop:

cd ~/Desktop/make-everything-better
Once you're in there, all git commands (git add, git commit, git push, etc.) will apply to that repo automatically. You can confirm you're in the right place by running git status — it should show you your files rather than an error.

Tip: If you're not sure of the path, you can just type cd  (with a space) in terminal and then drag your project folder from Finder straight into the terminal window. It'll auto-fill the path for you.

reeddaw@Reeds-Macbook-Pro-2 make_everything_better % git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Add gitignore"
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Even though I see the gitignore file in the repo, this is what the output of the command is giving me

12:42 PM
That's actually fine — it means the .gitignore was already committed and pushed (you can see it right there in your repo on GitHub). The "nothing to commit" message just means Git is saying "I already know about this file, there's nothing new to add."

You're all set! Your repo is clean and up to date. Now you can run git pull once just to make sure your local copy is fully synced, and then you're ready to start making changes.

Screenshot 2026-02-27 at 12.42.50 PM.png
Ah but when I do an "ls" it doesn't show the gitignore file in there. Is that correct?

12:43 PM
That's the dot-file hiding behavior I mentioned earlier! The .gitignore is there, it's just invisible to ls by default. Run:

ls -a
The -a flag means "show all including hidden files" and you'll see it pop up. You're good!

Awesome thank you. Based on my document what do you think we should add to it next? To take things in steps/stages

12:46 PM
Looking at your doc, I'd suggest this progression — each step is self-contained and buildable in one sitting:

Stage 2: Multiple puppies / cute animals Still in Mood Boost territory but adds some variety. Swap the single dog API for a few options (dogs, cats, maybe red pandas) and let the user pick. Gets you comfortable with adding UI elements and settings without changing the core architecture much.

Stage 3: Inspirational quotes Add a second tab or toggle alongside the puppy — just a text display pulling from a free quotes API. This is when you start thinking about navigation/layout in the popup, which sets you up for the multi-mode structure you described.

Stage 4: The mode selector This is the big structural one — adding the 4 modes (Mood Boost, Interrupt Anxiety, Micro Productivity, Chaos) as actual selectable options. Most of the features from your doc slot into one of these buckets, so once this shell exists, adding features becomes much easier.

Stage 5: Interrupt Anxiety mode The breathing bubble and grounding prompts. This is probably your highest-value feature for real daily use, and the animated breathing exercise is a fun technical challenge (CSS animations).

I'd hold off on the AI-enhanced version and the tab-detection features until later — those require more permissions, a backend, and potentially an API key, so they're a different level of complexity.

Does Stage 2 sound like the right next step, or is there a different feature pulling at you?

Yeah let's go with stage 2

12:49 PM
A few quick questions to make sure I build it the way you want:

Waiting on your answers before I start building!

Q: How should the user pick the animal type?
A: Buttons at the top (Dog / Cat / Surprise me)

Q: Which animals should be included? (Select all that apply)
A: Dogs, Cats, Red Pandas, Foxes

12:50 PM
Let me build that out!


Edited 2 files, viewed a file, created a file
Edited 2 files, viewed a file, created a file
Replace both files in your local repo folder with these. Here's what changed and what to know:

What's new:

5 selector buttons at the top — Dog, Cat, Fox, Red Panda, and Surprise (which randomly picks one of the four)
Switching animal auto-fetches immediately so there's no extra click needed
Each animal has its own set of captions with matching personality
Each animal uses a different free public API — all no-auth required:
Dogs → dog.ceo (same as before)
Cats → thecatapi.com
Foxes → randomfox.ca
Red Pandas → some-random-api.com
After you copy the files over, hit refresh on chrome://extensions and test it out. The one most likely to have an occasional hiccup is the Red Panda API since it's a smaller community project — if images aren't loading you'll see the error state with the 😢.

Once you've tested it, commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Stage 2: multi-animal selector"
git push

how do I get it so I don't have to enter my user name and password everytime for a git push

12:59 PM
You need to set up an SSH key. It sounds intimidating but it's a one-time setup. Here's the full flow:

Step 1: Generate an SSH key

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
Just hit Enter through all the prompts to accept defaults (no passphrase needed unless you want extra security).

Step 2: Copy your public key

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
That copies it to your clipboard silently.

Step 3: Add it to GitHub

Go to GitHub → click your profile photo → Settings
Left sidebar → SSH and GPG keys
Click New SSH key
Give it a name (like "My MacBook") and paste in the key → Add SSH key
Step 4: Switch your repo to use SSH instead of HTTPS

This is the step people often miss. Run this in your repo:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/make_everything_better.git
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Step 5: Test it

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like "Hi YOUR_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated."

After that, git push will just work with no password prompt ever again.

When I click the refresh button on chrome://extensions, it does not refresh with the changes. How do I ensure it does that

1:03 PM
The most common reason is that Chrome is loading the files from a different folder than the one you're editing. Let's figure out which folder Chrome actually loaded.

On your chrome://extensions page, click the "Service worker" or "details" link on your extension card — it'll show you the exact file path Chrome is using. Make sure that path matches the folder where you're saving your edits.

If they don't match, the fix is:

Click "Load unpacked" again
Navigate to the correct folder (your GitHub repo folder)
Remove the old duplicate entry if there is one
If the paths do match and it's still not refreshing, try:

Closing the popup completely before hitting refresh (if the popup is open, Chrome sometimes holds onto the old version)
After hitting the refresh button, right-click the extension icon → Inspect popup → in the DevTools window that opens, hit Cmd+Shift+R for a hard reload
The "close the popup first, then refresh, then reopen" sequence fixes it 90% of the time.

The random API for pandas is not working. Can you instead replace it with random-d.uk api

1:06 PM

Searched the web
Searched the web

Good news — random-d.uk is actually a duck API (not pandas!), so I'll swap the Red Panda entry to use it instead. The endpoint is https://random-d.uk/api/random which returns a JSON object with a url field.


Replace red panda API with random-d.uk duck API
Replace red panda API with random-d.uk duck API
Also need to update the button label in the HTML from Red Panda to Duck:


Edited a file, ran a command, read a file
Edited a file, ran a command, read a file
One heads up — random-d.uk is actually a duck API, not pandas! So I've swapped the 4th button from Red Panda 🐼 to Duck 🦆. You now have dogs, cats, foxes, and ducks — honestly a great lineup.

Copy both files into your repo, refresh the extension, and you should be good. Then commit:

git add .

hmm, darn the duck API isn't working either. Do you have a suggestion on another animal we can use?

1:09 PM
Let me find a reliable free API that actually works.


Searched the web
Searched the web

I'd suggest Shiba Inu via shibe.online — it's been around for years, requires no auth, and has a great track record. The endpoint just returns an array of image URLs, dead simple. Let me swap it in:

1:09 PM
Let me test a few options before committing to one.


Ran 2 commands
Ran 2 commands
Network requests are blocked in my environment so I can't test them directly, but based on reliability reputation I'd suggest one of these three — all free, no auth required:

Option A: Shiba Inu — shibe.online/api/shibes — one of the oldest and most reliable animal APIs out there. Yes it's another dog, but Shibas are a very different vibe from the regular dog API.

Option B: Bunny — api.bunnies.io/random — returns random rabbit photos, solid uptime.

Option C: Lizard — nekos.life/api/v2/img/lizard — chaotic but reliable, part of a well-maintained API.

Which one appeals to you? Or if you want I can just pick the most reliable one and swap it in.

Let's do Option C: Lizard

1:10 PM

Edited a file, ran a command
Edited a file, ran a command
Also update the button in the HTML:


Edited a file, ran a command, read a file
Edited a file, ran a command, read a file
Both files are ready. The 4th button is now 🦎 Lizard using the nekos.life API. Copy them over, refresh the extension, and test it out. If for any reason the lizard API also flakes, let me know and we'll try the bunny one.

git add .

Lizard works great. Ok next, I'd like to add a new section, inspirational quotes. 

I want a user to be able to choose between different options of how to make their life better first. 

So when they open the plug-in they get two options now: 
1. Cute Animal Pictures
2. Inspirational quotes

1:14 PM
Before I build, a couple of quick questions on how you want it to look and feel:

Q: How should the two options be presented when you open the extension?
A: A toggle switch between the two modes

Q: For the quotes section, where should the quotes come from?
A: A free quotes API (random quotes from the web)

1:25 PM
One more quick one before I build — want the extension to remember which mode you were last in when you close and reopen it, or always start fresh on the animals side?

Q: Should the extension remember which mode you were last using?
A: Yes, remember last mode

1:26 PM
Great, building it now. This will also require a small update to manifest.json to add the storage permission so Chrome lets us save the last mode.


Ran 4 commands, viewed a file, read a file
Ran 4 commands, viewed a file, read a file
All three files need to be updated this time — copy all of them into your repo folder. Here's what changed:

manifest.json — added "storage" to permissions. This is what allows Chrome to remember your last mode.

popup.html — added the sliding toggle at the top and a quotes panel below. The red pill slides left/right between the two modes.

popup.js — added the full quotes flow using quotable.io (free, no auth), mode switching logic, and chrome.storage.local to save and restore your last mode on open.

After copying, refresh the extension on chrome://extensions, then:

git add .
git commit -m "Stage 3: add quotes mode with toggle and persistent mode memory"
